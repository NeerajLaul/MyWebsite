    aboutme: "After completing my Mechanical Engineering degree from Savitribai Phule Pune University with a CGPA of 7.82, I began delving into the intricate world of coding. While I was always interested in coding since high school, and even learned a bit of Python and Django in my spare time during engineering, I could only learn it in a structured way after completing my degree. To that end, I completed a course in Python programming and am currently completing an advanced certificate course in Full Stack Development from IIT-Roorkee. Apart from technical skills, I am also an accomplished musician and a video editor. Do check out my band's songs from the YouTube link in the footer!",
